# SDLC Study of NASA's Flight Software

## Repository Summary

### This repo looks closely at the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for NASA's flight software. The aim is to check different SDLC types and see which ones work best for super-safe airplane and space software.

### It focuses on gathering requirements, handling risks, planning checks, and comparing the main models.

## Repository Layout

### First Report:
#### This is the starting point—the early version of the SDLC study, before we fixed the requirements or picked a final model.

### Final Report:
#### This is the complete one. We improved requirements, added risk checks, compared Waterfall, Incremental, and Spiral models, and put it all together.

## Branching Plan

### The main branch has the first report.

### We made a new branch for changes—like better requirements, validation steps, and choosing the best model.

### When done, we merged it back to main.

### This shows how to use GitHub for tracking versions, docs, and branches.

## Why This Repo?

### It's for a college project:

#### •Comparing SDLC models (Waterfall, Incremental, Spiral)

#### •Real-world requirements work

#### •Risk checks for critical safety software

#### •Planning tests and checks

#### •Managing everything with GitHub
